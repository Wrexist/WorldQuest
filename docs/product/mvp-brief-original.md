Missing Phase 0

Before design.

Research

This should become its own document.

Competitors

Study:

Duolingo
Seterra
GeoGuessr
Kahoot
Brilliant
Elevate
Peak
Lumosity
Quizlet
Atlas Mission
Worldle
Sporcle
JetPunk
StudySmarter

For every competitor answer:

What do they do well?
What keeps users coming back?
What do users complain about?
How do they monetize?
Where can WorldQuest be meaningfully different?
Product Bible

Every successful startup ends up with this.

One document.

Never changing vision.

Contains:

Mission

Vision

Values

Brand personality

Target audience

Core principles

Feature philosophy

Design philosophy

Roadmap

North Star metric

Success metrics

Content standards

This becomes the reference for every decision.

User Personas

Not one.

Probably 6-8.

Example:

Emma

10 years old

Likes Roblox

School geography

Short attention span

Alex

18

Travelling

Likes flags

Competitive

Sarah

Teacher

Uses classrooms

Needs assignments

Dad

Pays Premium

Tracks children

Every feature should serve at least one persona.

Information Architecture

Don't just make screens.

Map the whole product.

Example

Home

├── Daily Quest
├── Continue Lesson
├── Friends
├── League
├── Events

Explore

├── Globe
├── Continents
├── Countries
├── Collections

Learn

├── Countries
├── Capitals
├── Flags
├── Landmarks

Profile

Premium


This prevents navigation problems later.

Learning System

This is probably the most important missing piece.

Don't build quizzes.

Build a learning engine.

Each knowledge item should have:

Difficulty

Mastery

Review schedule

Success rate

Last practiced

Confidence score

Memory strength

Review interval

Forget curve

Estimated recall probability

Now the app becomes intelligent.

XP Economy

This deserves its own design.

Where does XP come from?

Correct answer

Perfect lesson

Daily quest

First lesson

Friend invite

Achievements

Streak

Collection completion

Speed bonus

No mistakes

Then:

Where is XP spent?

Avatar

Themes

Pets

Badges

Map skins

Titles

Animations

Without sinks, XP becomes meaningless.

Achievement System

Probably around 300 achievements eventually.

Categories:

Exploration

Countries

Flags

Perfect scores

Consistency

Collections

Events

Social

Premium

Hidden

Legendary

Progression

Not just levels.

Have multiple systems.

Explorer Level

Region Mastery

Country Completion

Global Completion

League Rank

Collections

Achievements

Titles

Season Rank

Prestige

Live Operations

Most apps underestimate this.

Plan recurring content from the beginning.

Daily

Weekly

Monthly

Seasonal

Yearly

Examples:

Olympics

World Cup

Earth Day

UN Day

Halloween

Christmas

Summer travel

These create reasons to return.

Content Pipeline

Don't hardcode questions.

Create a content system.

Country

↓

Facts

↓

Question templates

↓

Generated lessons

↓

Difficulty tags

↓

Review rules

Now adding new content becomes a data task instead of engineering.

Accessibility

Include from day one.

Color blindness

Screen reader

Reduced motion

Large text

Haptics

Captions

High contrast

Offline mode

This is much easier to build early than retrofit.

Localization

Don't wait.

Build for translation from the first commit.

Never hardcode strings.

Store everything in language files.

Then English, Swedish, Spanish, German, French, Portuguese become straightforward additions.

Analytics

Decide before launch.

Track:

Lesson started

Lesson completed

Question answered

Wrong answer

Correct answer

XP earned

Streak

Drop-off point

Retention

Time per lesson

Feature usage

Countries learned

These events will tell you where users lose interest.

Notifications

This deserves planning.

Examples:

Your streak is waiting.

Europe needs you.

One more lesson to level up.

Japan is almost mastered.

Your friend passed you.

Avoid spam. Notifications should feel like invitations, not pressure.

Backend Permissions

Define roles.

Guest

User

Premium

Teacher

Parent

Admin

Moderator

Support

Future-proofing this early avoids painful migrations.

Security

Think ahead.

Rate limiting

Cheat detection

Server-side XP validation

Cloud save

Secure leaderboards

Privacy for children

GDPR

COPPA (if targeting children in the U.S.)

Quality

Have a Definition of Done.

A feature isn't complete until:

Works
Tested
Responsive
Accessible
Localized
Analytics added
Haptics added
Animations polished
Offline behavior handled
Error states handled
Hidden Screens

Teams often forget these.

Empty states

Offline

No internet

Loading

Skeleton loading

404

500

Maintenance

Update required

No notifications

First launch

Permission denied

Session expired

Delete account

Change email

Change password

Biometric login

Welcome back

These small flows make the app feel complete.

Design System

Don't stop at colors.

Define:

8-point spacing grid

Corner radius scale

Elevation

Motion durations

Animation curves

Icon sizes

Typography scale

Shadows

Glass effects

Illustration style

Component states

This is what gives apps a consistent feel.

Technical Architecture

Think in modules.

Authentication

Learning Engine

Content Engine

Progress Engine

XP Engine

Achievement Engine

Quest Engine

Notification Engine

Social Engine

Analytics Engine

Payment Engine

Sync Engine

Offline Engine


Keeping these responsibilities separate will make the app much easier to maintain.

Testing

Plan it now.

Unit tests

Integration tests

UI tests

Beta testing

Internal testing

TestFlight

Google Play Internal Testing

Crash reporting

Performance monitoring

Roadmap

Don't think only about version 1.

Think:

MVP (v1.0)

Countries

Capitals

Custom learning paths
My biggest recommendation

If I could add one thing that would most increase your chances of building a world-class product, it would be this:

Treat WorldQuest as a platform, not an app.

Instead of thinking "How do I build geography lessons?", think "How do I build a learning engine that can teach any visual knowledge?"

If your content is driven by structured data, reusable question templates, mastery tracking, and a flexible progression system, then adding history, astronomy, biology, or culture becomes a content expansion rather than a rewrite.

That architectural decision made at the MVP stage can determine whether WorldQuest remains a great geography app or grows into a globally recognized learning platform.
